## Description

Boson is a modular command/task framework.  Thanks to its rich set of plugins,
it differentiates itself from rake and thor by being usable from irb and the
commandline, having automated views generated by hirb and allowing libraries to
be written as plain ruby. Works with ruby >= 1.9.2

## New vs Old Boson

If you've read about boson prior to 2012, you may be looking for a [version before
1.0](#TODO). Starting with 1.0, boson has been rewritten to have a smaller core
(no dependencies) with optional plugins to hook into its various features. The
major focus of 1.0 has been to provide an easy way for third-party gems to
create their executable and define subcommands with options.

## Example Executable

For a gem with an executable, bin/cow:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'boson/runner'

class CowRunner < Boson::Runner
  option :urgent, type: :boolean
  def say(text, options={})
    text.capitalize! if options[:urgent]
    puts text
  end

  def moo
    puts "MOOOO"
  end
end

CowRunner.start
```

You can now execute cow with say and moo subcommands:

    $ cow say hungry
    hungry
    $ cow moo
    MOOOO
    # use say's urgent option
    $ cow say hungry -urgent
    HUNGRY

You'll notice that this syntax is powerful and concise and is very similar to
Thor's API. Subcommands map to ruby methods and the class represents the executable.

## Comparison to Thor

Since boson and it's rewrite are both heavily inspired by Thor, it makes sense
to compare them.

First, what I consider pros boson has over thor. Boson

* is designed to handle plugins. This means it core parts are extendable by
  modules and core components like commands can have arbitrary metadata
  associated with them.
* has a rich set of plugins. See [boson-more](#TODO).
* has commands that are easily testable. Whereas thor has options that automagically
  appear in command methods, boson explicitly passes options to its command
  method as a hash i.e. `MyRunner.new.subcommand(arg, verbose: true)`. This
  also allows commands to just be called as ruby, with no magic to consider.
* supports custom-user option types i.e. creating a Date option type. See
  Boson::Options.
* automatically creates usage for your subcommand. With thor you need to
  manually define your usage with desc: `desc "SOME USAGE", "SOME DESCRIPTION"`
* is lenient about descriptions. Describe commands at your leisure. With thor
  you must define a desc.
* has a smaller blacklist for command names i.e. just Kernel + Object method
  names. Thor has a bigger [blacklist](#TODO) due to its design.

  Now for pros thor has over boson. Thor

  * is widely used and thus has been community QAed thoroughly.
  * supports generators as a major feature.
  * is more stable as its feature set is mostly frozen.
  * is used by rails and thus is guaranteed support for some time.

## Motiviation

Motivation for the new boson is all the damn executables I'm making.
